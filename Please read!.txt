Hello, this is a DDoS program created by crawling on a web stressor site.
Please be advised that users are responsible for the punishment and responsibility for abuse of this program.
I made it only for fun, and I made it because my friend would like to make it
This program is made using a site that does DDoS on the web like the stressthem.to site.
It was created using a total of 240 lines of code.
Program icons are my favorite wrappers..
It is recognized as a virus because it is made in Python.
There is really no virus, so please exclude it from the vaccine and use it ^_^

And when you use it, there are times when English comes out, so don’t be surprised
Please note that execution continues after a while.
And never touch the program called chromdriver in the same file.
You may get an error.
Please look carefully at the explanation in the middle of the program. There may be an unforeseen situation ㅠ_ㅠ

When you sign up for a member, the captcha code appears, but the image is just a combination of numbers + English.
It will appear, but you can use it along with it.

If you have any questions or errors in the program, please contact the above contact information.
This program is not a DOS (denial of service attack)
Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS).

Again, this program is made for fun only
Any abuse is at your own risk.
Thank you.
